# Lab 5 Report: Bias–Variance

Fill in concise answers under each heading. You can paste plots or reference notebook cells.

## Question 1: Data and baseline model
- Dataset (or synthetic generation) and why chosen:
- Baseline model and metrics (e.g., MSE/R2):
- Key observation(s):

## Question 2: Model complexity vs error
- What complexity dimension did you vary (degree/depth/regularization/etc.)?
- Describe and interpret the train vs test error curves:
- Where is underfitting vs overfitting evident?

## Question 3: Bias vs Variance interpretation
- Identify low/high bias regions and low/high variance regions:
- Tie observations to bias–variance theory (1–3 sentences):

## Question 4: Regularization effect
- Which regularizer(s) and hyperparameters did you try?
- How did errors/curves change vs no regularization?
- What does this imply about bias–variance trade-off here?

## Question 5: Conclusions and recommendations
- Final takeaway(s) about model selection for this dataset:
- Recommended configuration(s) and why:
- Any caveats or next steps:
